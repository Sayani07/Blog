# About

Hello, folks! Welcome to my home page. I am doing PhD at the [Econometrics and Business Statistics Department](https://www.monash.edu/business/econometrics-and-business-statistics/) of [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/). Currently, I'm primarily focussing on building statistical and  visualisation tools for analyzing spatially distributed big time series data.

*Supervisors* :  [Rob J Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/),  [Di Cook](http://www.dicook.org/)

_Be kind, remember you are collaborating with your future self_
